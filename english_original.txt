	g15=I can't explain it.
g16=I don't get it. I was ready to pull the trigger...

	g19=But you ended up at this place for a reason.
g20=I just wanted to get away.
g21=I couldn't live with myself anymore.

pe6=There you go!
pe7=I'll just wait for it to finish.

pe8=Let's see.
pe9=... an ice cube?!
pe10=This feels way too familiar.
pe11=There must be something inside the ice cube.

	gr6=And you don't know me you say, mmm?
gr7=... Greed.
gr8=What do you want from me?
	gr9=Mmm? I want you not to forget me!
	gr10=You will need me and my ruthlessness!
	gr11=How could you ever succeed without me, mmm?
gr12=Listen, I tried to change for a reason.
gr13=Maybe I wouldn't have got far without you, but...
gr14=... Maybe I would've found a better life.
	gr15=Mmm? A better life?
	gr16=YOU FOOL!
	gr17=You got what you deserved!
	gr18=You should've stayed with me; you would've got IT ALL!

	gr21=Look, together we can...
	gr22=WHAT NOW!?

		gr25=SILENCE!
		gr26=My apologies for interrupting like this.
		gr27=Listen to me.
		gr28=It's true that he helped you to achieve your goals.
		gr29=But you were young. You're still young.
		gr30=Did you know then what you wanted?
	gr31=Sure he did! You did, I did, we ALL did!
	gr32=He needs me, and you, Reason, can't deny that from him!
	gr33=Only I am driving him to succeed. Who else would do it, if not for me!?
		gr34=Yes, you're not entirely wrong.
		gr35=But maybe all he needs is a push in the right direction - a new lease on life.
	gr36=Mmm?
		gr37=You have to trust me.
		gr38=Go and wake up Hope, he's the only one that can help you.
	gr38_1=WAIT! Don't listen to his nonsense!

saw4=Okay, I need to saw the plank a little shorter.
saw5=This should do.

ai1=This fence's missing a piece.
ai2=I'm almost tempted to fix it.

ai3=I'm fixing the fence!
ai4=Okay, I'm going to need a hammer and some nails.

ai5=It won't hold unless I nail it.

ai6=That should do it.
ai7=I never thought I'd enjoy stuff like this.

ai8=I don't mind fixing the fence.
ai9=I'm going to need some wood and tools, though!

ai10=I'm not that handy, but it should hold.

	re4=I'm so pleased to see a little smile on your face.
	re5=You're in the domain of Hope.
	re6=This place is an illusion, but it could reflect reality.
re7=An illusion...?
re8=Yeah, I figured I wouldn't be able to stay here.
	re9=Now, now... don't be like that.
	re10=I told you it could reflect reality, didn't I?

re20=Thank you.
re21=I did try, you know?
re22=But it's not an easy task. I let myself down.
	re23=Well, this is your journey to recovery.
	re24=It's not supposed to be easy.

	vi4=Isn't it obvious?
	vi5=You've come to see me live.

	vi9=Fine, I'll play along!
	vi10=I'm a man of many accomplishments.
	vi11=I'm brave, fearless, handsome, and quite popular among the ladies.

	vi13=I'm invincible!
vi14=Good for you!
vi15=Well, I need to get going...
	vi16=Wait, wait! There's more to it.
	vi17=I could go on and on about my deeds.
	vi18=But you're new here, am I correct?
vi19=Well noticed.
	vi20=In that case, please allow me to explain something.
	vi21=We're... kinda... uh...
	vi22=Well, you could say we're.... stuck here.
vi23=You don't say?
	vi24=See that gorilla over there?
	vi25=Once a day only one of us can leave.
	vi26=But only for a few hours!
vi27=Keep talking.
	vi28=We had this agreement with the other people...
	vi29=Once a day we play cards, and the winner gets the chance to leave.
	vi30=A chance to solve the puzzle beyond the door.
vi31=Okay, that's not weird at all.
	vi32=LUCKILY! I'm the master of cards.
	vi33=I've never lost, and that's why it's me walking out that door at the end of each day.
vi34=I get it, you're good!
vi35=Do you think I could play too?
	vi36=You? Against me?
	vi37=.........
	vi38=HAHAHAHA!
	vi39=Sure, kid!
	vi40=That'd be hilarious.
vi41=I look forward to it.

vo1=Did you manage to solve the puzzle?
vo2=It was way too difficult for me.
	vo3=Hah!
	vo4=I only had to look at it once, and I solved it.
	vo5=So very easy.
	vo6=But then again, these things are easy for me.
	vo7=Here, take this as proof so you can be amazed.
	
	ru1=WHERE do you think you're going?
	ru2=That'd be my room, you know?
ru3=Uh, sorry.

	ru4=I see you're back to hear about my brave deeds.
	ru5=I once fought with a gigantic beast...
ru6=Uh, maybe later.

ru7=You look like a smart man.
	ru8=Why, thank you!
	ru9=Did you need something?
ru10=I'm struggling to solve this puzzle.
ru11=Maybe you could help?
	ru12=You've come to the right man.
	ru13=I, George Blackwell, am the master of puzzles.
	ru14=Hand it over, please.
ru15=Here you go.
	ru16=Now let me focus, this shouldn't take long.
ru17=Alright.

ru18=How's it going?
	ru19=.........
ru20=Whoa, he's focused!

	ru21=I just need a pen, so I can write down the solution...
	ru22=That kid will be stunned to see how amazing I am!
	ru23=Maybe he'll even reward me...?
	ru24=Oooooh, exciting!
	ru25=Okay, Georgie boyyy!
	ru26=Focus!
	ru27=The combination...
	ru28=Six...
	ru29=Six... Four...
	ru30=Six... Four... Nine.
	ru31=Open sesame!
	ru32=All set, now that I have my pen.
	
	ru33=Mm...
	ru34=Maybe I should suit up to REALLY impress that kid.
	ru35=Yes... I believe that would make him super impressed.

	ru36=But then again, would that be too much...?
	ru37=Yes, yes... I gotta play it cool.
	ru38=Time to IMPRESS!
	
ru39=Phew, that was close!
ru40=Not awkward at all...
	
saf1=It's a safe made of thick steel.
saf2=Is he hiding something?
saf3=I need the combination to find out.

saf4=What the hell is this thing?
saf5=.........
saf6=OH, I understand!
saf7=He's cheating on cards!
saf8=This gadget pulls an ace from his sleeve.
saf9=No wonder he always wins.
saf10=I think I might just sabotage him.

saf11=That should do it, he won't notice a thing before it's too late.

saf12=The deed is done, and today his luck will change.
	
	ea1=There's something fishy about him...
		ea2=I know!
		ea3=Against all the odds, he keeps winning!
	ea4=Sooner or later his luck will turn.
		ea5=Still, it was foolish to agree on his terms.
	ea6=Today it's our turn to shine!
		ea7=I hope so, dear.
		
	ea8=We will win today, honey.
	ea9=I'm sure of it!
		ea10=I hope... we've never won before.
	ea11=It's only a matter of time.
	
	ea12=How on earth does he keep winning time after time?
	ea13=I've got a funny feeling about this!
		ea14=Calm down, honey.
		ea15=I agree, though. There's something going on.
			
po1=Can I pass, please?
	po2=GRRR!
po3=Maybe later.

		uk11=You've spent several days going over that thing already!
	uk11_1=QUIET WOMAN!
		uk11_2=Mister! You don't SHOUT at me like that!
		uk11_3=You better give him that puzzle or ELSE!
	uk12=I'm sorry, my love...
	uk13=Fine!
	uk14=There's no way you can solve that, though.
uk15=I'll still give it a try, thank you.
	uk16=Whatever.
	
ok1=What's up, dude?
ok2=Go away.

ok3=I solved the puzzle!
ok4=I won't believe it until I see it.

ik1=Hey, I managed to solve the puzzle.
ik2=I thought maybe you'd like to have it back?
	ik3=You did, huh?
	ik4=I'm not sure...
		ik5=Just swallow your pride for once in your life, you old fool!
	ik6=Yes, yes, my love.

ik15=What time?
		ik16=To play cards.

		ik18=Of course he can join us, he helped you!
	
op1=Great, back to the shitty world.

		pok1=Alright, the rules are simple.
		pok2=The winner gets the right to leave.
		pok3=Let's play cards!
	pok4=Hey, how are you all doing?
	pok5=I wonder if Mr. Blackwell will win again?
pok6=I wouldn't count on it.
pok7=You're in for a surprise.
		pok8=Huh?
		pok9=Anyway, I feel lucky today!
			pok10=Hah!
			pok11=This game is not about luck; it's a game of skill.
			pok12=And thus, there's only one possible outcome.
				pok13=You're way too confident, Mr. Blackwell.
				pok14=You can't always win.
			pok15=Time will tell, Madam.
					pok16=Always the same topic.
					pok17=Can't we just get along?
					pok18=Let the best player win.
		pok19=NO!
		pok20=There's something fishy about him winning all the time.
				pok21=You're right, dear.
				pok22=But we're prepared...
pok23=Huh...?
pok24=Let's just play, okay?
	pok25=Alright then, show me your hands.
					pok26=Queen of spades.
	pok27=Ten of hearts.
				pok28=Jack of clubs.
		pok29=Eight of spades.
pok30=King of diamonds.
	pok31=The new guy is winning...!
					pok32=Mr. Blackwell needs an ace to win.
		pok33=There's no way he can pull that off!
			pok34=Oh, you fools...
			pok35=Watch me!
			
			pok36=Uh...
	pok37=What is that...?
					pok38=MR. BLACKWELL!
		pok39=I knew it!
		pok40=He's cheating!
			pok41=No, it's just that...
				pok42=YOU WEASEL!
			pok43=You don't understand...!
			pok44=I'm so close...!
			pok45=You don't have what it takes...!
		pok46=SHUT UP!

th1=It's an old film projector.

	bt1=Oi, how are you doing, Sir?
bt2=Not too shabby.
bt3=Uh, who are you?
	bt4=Oi, it's me Comfort.
bt5=Comfort, ey?
bt6=So what have you got for me?
	bt7=Oh, this time I'm offering you a bottle of great scotch.
	bt8=But don't knock it down like a cowboy!
	bt9=Savor it.
bt10=Uh, well I can appreciate a quality scotch.
bt11=But the last time I had some, it didn't end too well.
	bt12=Oi, but I have to offer you some comfort.
	bt13=You couldn't find me from coffee anymore, so we needed something stronger.
	bt14=In this case, whiskey.
bt15=Yeah well...
	bt16=Let's have some, it'll get you going again!
bt17=.........
	bt18=Oi, what's wrong?
bt19=I don't feel like that would help now.
	bt20=But I need to comfort you...!
	bt21=Just have some.
bt22=No thank you, I'm fine.
	bt23=OI, just take a swig!
bt24=Fuck this.

cu1=Ah, this must be the work desk for cutting the film.
cu2=I want to try it!

	xc1=How do you feel?
xc2=Confused...
xc3=What's going on, Reason?
	xc4=You're making progress.
xc5=It sure as hell doesn't feel that way.
	xc6=Yes, but you can only restore yourself little by little.
	xc7=You need to wholly understand things.
	xc8=Because simply knowing something doesn't mean you understand it fully.
	xc9=And some things you can only grasp by finding yourself.
	xc10=By finding Hope.
xc11=I got it: find Hope and all my problems will be solved!
	xc12=There's no need to be sarcastic.
	xc13=Things are never that simple.
	xc14=But you already knew that, didn't you?
xc15=I'm sorry, I'm just struggling to grasp any this.
	xc16=You don't need to, not now.
	xc17=But carry on, and eventually you'll realize it all.
xc18=Uh, thanks for the encouragement, Reason.
	xc19=Stay strong.

	21=Oh?
	22=HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
	23=I hold all the power over you!
	24=You gave it to me.
	25=We don't need to do this, not now.
	26=Help yourself instead, go and find Hope.
	27=Forget me.
28=.........
29=NO!
30=I'm not leaving before I overcome you!
	31=Maybe you've got a backbone after all.

	da7=Still afraid of whispers from the darkness?
	da8=You're not worthy, fool!
	da9=Nobody loves you.
da10=Be gone, and leave me alone!

	da11=Why do you even try?
	da12=You deserve nothing.
	da13=You won't last the night.
	da14=Give up!

	r5=You keep questioning the purpose behind your journey and existence.
	r6=But every step you take fills you with silent light.
r7=Can you please stop being so poetic and speak plainly so I understand?
	r8=I'm merely pointing you in the right direction.
	r9=See, I cannot tell you what is what - realization must come from within.
	r10=Only you can do it and no one else.
r11=Yeah, I think I understand.
	r12=This place must wake some painful memories in you, am I right?
r13=Yeah, Mrs. Goodwin...
	r14=Good, you shouldn't confuse Agony with malice.
	r15=He is a part of you and plays a role in all this.
	r16=Give yourself a chance.
	r17=Give Hope a chance.
r18=I'll try. Thank you for encouragement, Reason.
	r19=Thank you for listening to me.
	
ie1=He's long gone; you can tell by the smell.
ie1_1=That was rather bizarre.

ie2=E5, F#5... those are notes, I'm sure of it.
ie2_1=No more notes but those markings must mean something.

	i1=Oh, hi!
i2=I put some medicine in your...
	i3=Irrelevant! No need to explain yourself.
i4=Oo-kay.
i5=Who are you?
	i6=Obviously, I am Inspiration.
i7=Inspiration?
i8=Uh, shouldn't you be, you know... more inspiring?
	i9=Yeah, maybe I should.
	i10=But you left me behind a long time ago.
	i11=We used to work together when you were younger.
	i12=Playing piano, painting, building stuff...
i13=Those are some good memories.
i14=I wonder why I stopped?
	i15=All work and no play made you a dull boy!
i16=Yeah, I suppose.
	i17=You know, you could use me every now and then.
i18=Okay, so what do you have for me?
	i19=I did write a small tune.
	i20=It's a bit generic since you never questioned my creation.
	i21=Anyway, it should help you on your path.
i22=Let's hear it, then.

dr1=Look at me, looting drugs!
dr2=Surely this syringe will come in use.

pu1=Got it!
pu2=That must be the right combination.

e7=I know, but I do.
e8=I do...
	e9=I'm Forgiveness.
	e10=Let me help you.
e11=How...?
	e12=Please, hear me out.
	e13=There's a reason why you can't forgive yourself.
	e14=It's all connected.
	e15=Your past, your parents...
	e16=How their business was taken away from them.
	e17=Everything in life moulds you.
e17_1=Yeah, and I did the same to Mrs. Goodwin.
e17_2=I took away her home!
	e18=You've put so much time and energy into regretting that decision.
	e19=Just... why?
	e19_1=Regret is all you seem to do.
e20=I can't just let it go.
e21=I don't think I ever can stop blaming myself.
e22=It's like something is stopping me.
	e23=Maybe there is Something more.
	e24=Maybe you need to find that Something.
	e25=And then, in the throes of your journey, maybe you'll be ready to forgive yourself.
	e26=I'm not Reason, but I advise you to carry on.
	e27=You're bound to find what you're looking for.
	e28=Have faith, and you will restore yourself.

o4=Are you sure they're coming?
	o5=Yes, I'm sure.
o6=O... o-kay then.
		o7=But before that, you need to tidy your room.
o8=Okay, dad, I will tidy up after breakfast.
		o9=What are my old ears hearing?
		o10=You promise?
o11=I promise I'll tidy my room!
	o12=That's great, honey.
		o13=That's exactly how big boys like you behave.

e16=Why are you here...?
	e17=I already told you - I'm here so you can confront me at last.

	e24=And that action created Something else...
e25=Huh...
e26=I do miss my parents more than anything.
e27=But it was easier for me not to think about it.
e28=Why would I torture myself with the memory?
e29=It would never bring them back...
	e30=You're not wrong: they're gone, but their memory is not.
	e31=You need to treasure it.
	e32=Do not avoid the thought of your parents.
	e33=And that is why I was sent here.
	e34=You need to go through me and deal with what was once forgotten.
	e35=It's the only way.
e36=Okay, okay...
e37=How do I do that?

[clifford]
	s1=Tell me, why are you here?

s3=I don't think I'm a bad person.
s4=But I've hurt so many people for my own selfish gain.
	s5=Tell me about it.
s6=Well... I've done everything by the book.
s7=I mean, I've done nothing illegal - just my job.
s8=But it involved dealing with people who were in desperate need of help.
s9=And yet I took away the last of their hope.
s10=Even though it's alright according to the law.
	s11=Yes, I'm aware of the nature of your work.
	s12=I see a conflict between you and your work-self.
	s13=You must see it yourself?
s14=Yeah, I do.
	s15=So...
	s16=Do you think you're doing anything to contribute to this problem?
s17=I tried...
s18=But, I'm afraid I've crossed the point of no return.
s19=See, I went to resign, to change the course of my future.
s20=But at that very day, I got to sign on as a partner with this company.
s21=My backbone snapped like a dry stick, and so I kept going.
	s22=Interesting...
	s23=You were aware of the conflict, but you decided to ignore it.
	s24=Sure... you got the partnership, but there's more to it.
	
	s25=Ah, our time seems to be up, Mr. Price.
	s26=I'd like to talk about your childhood the next time we meet.
	s27=I'm sure we can find some answers from there.

	e1=Last time you told me about your work, and how it got the better of you.
	e2=You had the chance to resign, but you did not.
	e3=You kept working, even when it was burning you slowly from the inside.
	e4=Today we're trying to delve deeper.
	e5=We will find reasons behind your decisions.
e6=If you say so.
	e7=Tell me, does it feel like you're in control?
e8=Uh... yeah.
e9=I believe so.
e10=I mean, I struggle to stand behind my voice.
	e11=Yes, I thought as much.
	e12=I suppose you also feel insecure?
e13=Yeah... I don't feel like I've much left to give.
	e14=What do you think? Why is your self-esteem so low?
e15=I wish I knew the answer.
	e16=Tell me about your childhood.
e17=What would you like to hear?
	e18=Just an overview - how was it?
e19=............
	e20=I'm aware of the tragedy you had to face.
e21=Yeah... I do miss my parents.
e22=............
e23=I had a happy childhood, but it ended way too soon.
	e24=I'm sorry to hear that.
	e25=Let's revisit that a little later.
	e26=Could you tell me more about your parents?
e27=They were the best - kind and understanding.
e28=They owned most idyllic coffee shop.
e29=I suppose that explains why I love coffee so much.
e30=Anyway, during the recession their business started to struggle.
e31=It got to the point where we had to sell our house.
	e32=Do you think these events have partially caused your urge for success?
e33=............
	e34=Ah, our time seems to be up, Mr. Price.
	e35=I'd like to hear more about your childhood during our next session.
	
	
	a1=Would you tell me, what happened after your parents' passing?
a2=They placed me in an orphanage, where I then grew up.
a3=It was okay, I suppose.
a4=I made good friends there with a boy called Charlie.
a5=Although I haven't seen him in ages.
	a6=Tell me more about it.
a7=Well... we were very close.
a8=But then when I reached adulthood, I moved to another city.
a9=To pursue a career from McDade, Bruton & Moore.
a10=I do regret not keeping in touch with Charlie.
a11=I regret it all.
	a12=It sounds like you're too harsh on yourself.
	a13=Maybe you shouldn't dwell on the past?
	a14=But now... I'd like to hear more about the death of your parents.
	a15=Such tradegy is bound to leave a mark.
a16=Nah... it's fine, doc!
a17=I try not to think about it, it's easier that way.
	a18=Tell me, how did that make you feel?
a19=I felt sad, but I was able to shut it away.
a20=I got over it surpisingly fast.
	a21=We all react differently to such loss.
	a22=But could it be possible you never really processed their passing?
	a23=Tell me, did you ever take time to yourself, just to mourn?
a24=............
a25=No, not really...
a26=But like I said, it's okay, I didn't need to.
	a27=Mr. Price, I believe you could be suffering from trauma.
	a28=It sounds like you're still in denial.
	a29=Instead of processing your loss, you shut it away.
	a30=Maybe in the silence, it's trauma moulding your every decision?
a31=I don't believe that's the case, doc.
a32=I mean, I do appreciate your help.
	a33=............
	a34=Ah, our time seems to be up.
	a35=Please, don't shy away from my words.
	a36=Give it some thought, and who knows what you might find.
[doh3]
	s1=Hey, you okay?
	s2=You look distracted.
s3=Whoa...
s4=Is that you, Charlie?
	s5=Eh.
	s6=How funny.
s7=What are you doing here?
	s8=You invited me, man!
	s9=We need to get you some beer.
	s10=It'll do you good, trust me.
s11=Uh, show me the way.

	s12=Cheers to old friends!
s13=Cheers!

s14=So, it's been... what... seven years?
	s15=Nine years.
s16=Whoa, that long already?
	s17=Yeah, tell me about it.
s18=What've you been up to?
	s19=That, my friend, is a long and boring story!
	s20=The usual kind of boring, you know.
	s21=I settled down, got married.
	s22=I'm also going to be a dad in a few months time.
s23=Whoa, congrats!
s24=I'm very happy for you, and you deserve everything.
	s25=Thanks!
	s26=And how about you?
	s27=For some reason we didn't keep in touch after you moved for work.
	s28=Speaking of, did you get the job?
s29=Unfortunately, yes.
	s30=Huh...?
s31=It's a long story...
	s32=I'd like to hear it.
s33=I need a beer first, you with me?
	s34=Down the hatch!
	
	s35_1=That was quite a story.
	s35=I'm sorry to hear about how things went for you.
s36=Don't be. I made my own choices, my own mistakes.
	s37=But still...
	s38=You're a good person.
s39=Thanks, Charlie.
	s40=Oh yeah - I forgot something, I'll be back in a minute.
	
		l1=Come find me.
		
x1=Hi Reason.
	x2=Someone's feeling cheerful.
x3=Heh, yeah...
	x4=So, how do you like all this?
	x5=Surrounded by friends.
	x6=In the warmth of the night.
x7=I feel welcome and safe here.
x8=Even hopeful.
	x9=You've come so far.
	x10=All the things you've gone through...
	x11=They're like fuel for Hope.
	x12=You're close to releasing the light inside of you.
x13=Sorry, I don't mean to be rude, but I just want to relax now.
x14=For now, I need to forget about everything.
	x15=No offense taken.
	x16=In fact, I encourage you to recharge with all this warmth.
x17=Thanks, Reason.

	c1=There you are.
	c2=I, uh, wrote you a letter.
	c3=It's important.
c4=Thanks, can I read it?
	c5=Not yet...
	c6=You need to wait for the right moment.
c7=Uh, mysterious!
	c8=Ah, I know how it sounds, but promise me you won't open it yet?
c9=I promise.
	c10=Thanks, you'll know when the time is right.
c11=Okay then.

dg1=Who's a good girl?!
[epilogue]
s1=............
s2=I must be close now.
s3=I want to see this through.
s4=To make sense to all of this.

	t1=Do you really want to do this?
	t2=You'll never vanquish me!

	t3=Prepare yourself!
	t4=I'll be there!

	g1=BOO!
	g2=Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you!
g3=Ah perfect, it's you again...
	g4=Mm?
	g5=How rude!
	g6=I'm here to help you out of this shit-hole.
g7=Huh?
	g8=You heard right!
g9=And how would you do that?
	g10=Do not underestimate me.
	g11=There is but one condition.
	g12=You shall never abandon me.
	g13=And that's it!
	g14=If you would just sign the agreement?

g15=Uh...
g16=I shouldn't.
	g17=Don't be an idiot!
	g18=I'm offering you a way out from this torment.
	g19=What's there even to think about?
g20=I suppose you have a point there.
g21=Just that...
	g22=Enough, sign!

		g23=ENOUGH!
	g24=Aaaaargh!
	g25=Not you again!
		g26=SILENCE!
		g27=Don't sign it, just think.
		g28=The journey...
		g29=Agony, Loss, Forgiveness, Love...
		g30=You are healing.
	g31=Here he is!
	g32=Reason and his poetic wisdom.
	g33=HAHAHAHAHA.
		g34=Listen to me.
		g35=You do not need him.
		g36=Not anymore.
g37=But he's offering a way out.
		g38=Not a way in which you want to go.
		g39=Trust me this last time.
g40=............

	g41=WHAT DID YOU DO?
	g42=NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

			g45=I'm free at last!
g46=Wha... what's happening?
		g47=You chose.
			g48=Thank you!
		g49=Welcome, Ambition.
g50=Ambition...?
			g51=There's a fine line between Greed and me.
		g52=You made the right choice.
g53=But... without Reason, I would've signed.
		g54=Don't forget that we're all connected.
		g55=You will need Ambition once you're out.
g56=Out...?
		g57=Was that a little smile on your face?
		g58=Keep your spirits high.
		g59=There is still Something locked away, deep inside.
			g60=You will need your all to conquer it.
			g61=Stay strong, you're almost there!

	mn18=Loss brings a painful memory.
		mn19=A memory you've locked away.
mn20=Uh...
		mn21=I'm so sorry, honey.
		mn22=But you have to face it.
	mn23=You're strong. You will overcome this.
mn24=I love you both.

		mn27=Think of us.

e1=Bo-bo-bo-boring.
e2=All my toys are in the new home already.
e3=And I'm hungry!

e4=There's no food in the oven.
e5=Also, don't we have a fridge?
e6=Dad said they'll bring some pizza.
e7=I want pizza, now!

e8=There's nothing there anymore.
e9=All the stuff is here in the kitchen.
e10=The new home is so much smaller.
e11=Oh well...!

e12=I don't know how to tell the time yet.
e13=But shouldn't Mom and Dad be back already?
e14=I'm going to eat at least TEN pizzas.
e15=Dad says I eat more than a horse.

x1=What is this...?
x2=Wh... what are you?

x3=Reason, what the hell is that thing?
	x4=It's the source of everything in you.
x5=Please, stop...
x6=Speak plainly so I can understand!
	x7=You must finally face it.
	x8=The dark place inside you that's holding you prisoner.
	x9=Insecurity...
	x10=Unworthiness...
	x11=The source of it all.
	x12=And here you are...
	x13=Ready to do so.
x14=I don't...
	x15=Listen to me now, for I am the Reason.
	x16=Tell me, what is that thing?
x17=It's...
x18=.........
	x19=Look closer.

x20=It is...
x21=... Trauma?
	x22=Yes...
	x23=The source of all things in you.
	x24=But now, after all these years you have the chance to overcome it.
x25=.........
x26=I...
x27=... can't.
x28=It's too powerful...

x29=And what's even the point...?
x30=You're on the brink of restoring yourself.

x31=But how could I ever overcome my loss...?
x32=By accepting and dealing with me.

x33=But with my job... how can I go on?
x34=You found me, and together we'll rise.

x35=What do I have left to fight for?
x36=I am somewhere out there. Find me.

x38=Challenge my creation.

x39=How can I ever forgive myself?
x40=Through me.

x46=I'll be there to comfort you.

x47=Okay, okay...!
	x48=You see now?
	x49=You're almost there, but you're missing something.
	x50=Think!

x51=The letter!
x52=The letter Charlie gave me.
x53=That has to be be it.

		le1=I knew you'd get this far.
		le2=You've always been determined.
		le3=But at the same time your insecurity negated your determination.
		le4=Leaving you exposed.
